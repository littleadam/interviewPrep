# interviewPrep
Software for interview preparation

This app checks for interview readiness of a person by a quiz from the preferred subject
this will ensure that questions are picked in an order for its own reference but will appear random to the users

This project consists of two modules, one for the questions contribution and another for evaluation. evaluation section allows users to skip questions to answer in the end.seperate pane will have reference to the unattended question . when clicked, it will take to the question. one must submit the current question to answer the left over questions

In future, the project will use AI tools to read a given document and frame questions by itself.

The project predicts thoughtful answers and guesses, thereby providing the approximate skill of the candidate


this can replace the traditional interview setup
